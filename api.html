 <h3> So, what <i>is</i> an API?</h3> 
 <div class="center">
 <p> Well, API stands for Application Programming Interface. This essentially means that an API is a set of tools that allow programmers to access services and data from a given application to make alternative applications. Let's take for an example the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/?ref=twc" target="_blank">Weather Underground API</a>. This website can retrieve weather from any given location. The site also contain API documentation on how to access the weather database and how to utilize those services. So what can you do with this API? The answer lies in your phone! Just about every weather app uses a weather API. With a tap on the icon, the weather app can quickly retrieve information from your given location and display the weather data that you desire. This is done by the mobile app doing some technical work behind the scene. As soon as you tap the button, the application is communicating with the weather API, telling the database which data it wants to display back to the phone. By now, you may wonder, why bother with an phone app? You can just go on to a weather website and do the same thing! Yes, that certainly can be done. However, the purpose of utilizing an API is that it can create applications that will provide an ease of access to information and services. Just tapping a app on your phone certainly beats opening a browser, typing in the site address and city just to get the weather, right? There are many other benefits in using an API, and it is a critical innovation to our day to day life. This short guide will go through the typical steps in understanding how to access an API and how to retrieve data from their databases. 
 


<h3>The World Bank API</h3> 
<div class="center">
<p>The World Bank is an organization that is dedicated to ending poverty and building prosperity in underdeveloped countries. In addition, the World Bank database contains each country's global development statistics. In this guide, we will be using the <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information" target="_blank">World Bank API</a> to create a simple engine that will output a given country GDP (current US $) from a minimum to maximum years. We will be accessing this database through using their country, query indicator, and delimiter parameters. Most API requires a key to authenticate the programmer and to allow access control. However, the World Bank does not require an API key, so we can jump over this process.
